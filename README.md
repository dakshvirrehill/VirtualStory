Name of the Application: VirtualStory

GVR SDK Version: v1.0.3

Purpose: In this project we were told to research on a particular industry or technology that VR could effect and I have chosen Storytelling. There is a huge potential of storytelling in VR as the application would explain to you.

Instructions and other important information:
In the beginning of the application you would see a simple start UI and after that simple instructions to navigate the scene.
There are five sub categories that I have researched upon in Storytelling and each are explained in different experiences spread out in one scene.
You will be navigating using waypoints and when you would start a sub category vr experience, I have used itween linear movement to move the camera.
All the sub category experiences are self explanatory except the horror storytelling experience.
I have not given much instructions in the horror scene because it is a horror scene. Therefore I would give you a hint to navigate.
Find objects that are clickable!
Two experiences are on the left side and two are on the right side of the starting point and horror is dead ahead. As you reach the middle point you can see that there are waypoints on both left and right and front.
Once you decide where to go you can come back using the same waypoints. Once all five of the experiences are over, the scene would automatically reset.

Problems Faced:
It was pretty difficult to find free 3D Models for what I wanted to do therefore I had to change my execution idea a ton of times. I really suggest to add a 3D Model making chapter in VR foundations as it is important too.
I had decided a museum first and a different scene for each and every sub category but I couldn't find a proper 3D model therefore I went with a park scene. It still looks relevant to the content as you do see animals and billboards in a park :D
I had to change my trees as they were really heavy and they slowed down my application. After changing the trees the application ran smoothly.
The horror experience door was closing or opening too late and itween movement was faster therefore I had to slow down that movement and let the door open smoothly.

What I liked about this project:
I had to do everything on my own. Granted I had the previous projects to help me out a little bit but the idea, the way to design, the way to set up, what all to do, what all to put up, the code, everything was done on my own. I even learnt a few
things about Unity Scripts while doing what I wanted to happen (I googled stuff). Therefore a pretty nice project experience. After creating this application, I do feel that I can make a good enough VR experience. Granted this app still has some
short comings which can be improved but I will do that in the next version ;)
